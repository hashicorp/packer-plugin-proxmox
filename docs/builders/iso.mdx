# Proxmox Builder (from an ISO)

Type: `proxmox-iso`
Artifact BuilderId: `proxmox.iso`

The `proxmox-iso` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve). The builder takes an ISO
image, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then
creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to
create new virtual machines within Proxmox.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

If no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used
in the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.

### Required:

- `proxmox_url` (string) - URL to the Proxmox API, including the full path,
  so `https://<server>:<port>/api2/json` for example.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_URL` environment variable.

- `username` (string) - Username when authenticating to Proxmox, including
  the realm. For example `user@pve` to use the local Proxmox realm. When using
  token authentication, the username must include the token id after an exclamation
  mark. For example, `user@pve!tokenid`. 
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_USERNAME` environment variable.

- `password` (string) - Password for the user.
  For API tokens please use `token`.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `token` (string) - Token for authenticating API calls.
  This allows the API client to work with API tokens instead of user passwords.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `node` (string) - Which node in the Proxmox cluster to start the virtual
  machine on during creation.

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_url` (string) - URL to an ISO file to upload to Proxmox, and then
  boot from. Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `iso_checksum` (string) - Checksum of the ISO file. Type of the checksum
  is infered based on string length, or can be explicitly prefixed with
  md5:, sha1:, sha256:, sha512: or set to none. Corruption of large files,
  such as ISOs, can occur during transfer from time to time. As such,
  setting this to none is not recommended.

### Optional:

  also be the ID of the final template. If not given, the next free ID on
  the node will be used.

- `memory` (int) - How much memory, in megabytes, to give the virtual
  machine. Defaults to `512`.

- `cores` (int) - How many CPU cores to give the virtual machine. Defaults
  to `1`.

  - `firewall` (bool) - If the interface should be protected by the firewall.
    Defaults to `false`.

  - `packet_queues` (int) - Number of packet queues to be used on the device.
    Values greater than 1 indicate that the multiqueue feature is activated.
    For best performance, set this to the number of cores available to the
    virtual machine. CPU load on the host and guest systems will increase as
    the traffic increases, so activate this option only when the VM has to
    handle a great number of incoming connections, such as when the VM is
    operating as a router, reverse proxy or a busy HTTP server. Requires
    `virtio` network adapter. Defaults to `0`.

- `disks` (array of objects) - Disks attached to the virtual machine.
  Example:

    `raw`.

  - `io_thread` (bool) - Create one I/O thread per storage controller, rather
    than a single thread for all I/O. This can increase performance when
    multiple disks are used. Requires `virtio-scsi-single` controller and a
    `scsi` or `virtio` disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_name` (string) - Name of the template. Defaults to the generated

  Defaults to `lsi`.

- `cloud_init` (bool) - If true, add a Cloud-Init CDROM drive after the virtual machine has been converted to a template.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `cloud_init_storage_pool` - (string) - Name of the Proxmox storage pool
  to store the Cloud-Init CDROM on. If not given, the storage pool of the boot device will be used.

- `additional_iso_files` (array of objects) - Additional ISO files attached to the virtual machine.
  Example:

  ```json
  [

      "unmount": true,
      "iso_checksum": "af2b3cc9fa7905dea5e58d31508d75bba717c2b0d5553962658a47aebc9cc386"
    }
  ]
  ```

    For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` form 0 to 5 and for
    `scsi` from 0 to 30.
    Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

  - `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
    proxmox datastore path, for example
    `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
    Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` OR `cd_files` must be specifed.

  - `iso_url` (string) - URL to an ISO file to upload to Proxmox, and then
    boot from. Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` OR `cd_files` must be specifed.

  - `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
    the ISO file.

  - `iso_checksum` (string) - Checksum of the ISO file.
  - `unmount` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template after finishing. Defaults to `false`.

  ### Optional
    - `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
      booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
      will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
      hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
      tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed. Overrides 
      any of `iso_file` or `iso_url` set. Requires `iso_storage_pool` to be set
      
      Usage example (JSON):
      
      ```json
      "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
      "cd_label": "cidata",
      ```
      
      Usage example (HCL):
      
      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```
      
      The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
      CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
      used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
      
      Since globbing is also supported,
      
      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```
      
      Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
      between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
      directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
      
      Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
      that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
      tools:
      
        * xorriso
        * mkisofs
        * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
        * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)

    
    - `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
      contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
      files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
      the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.
      
      Usage example (HCL):
      
      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
      cd_content = {
        "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
        "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
      }
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```

    - `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

- `http_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets
  `HTTPIP` from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.

- `vm_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets
  the VMs IP from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.

- `boot` - (string) - Override default boot order. Format example `order=virtio0;ide2;net0`.
  Prior to Proxmox 6.2-15 the format was `cdn` (c:CDROM -> d:Disk -> n:Network)

- `bios` - (string) - Set the machine bios. This can be set to ovmf or seabios. The default value is seabios.

- `efidisk` - (object) - Set the efidisk storage options. This need to be set if you use ovmf uefi boot

  ```json
  {
    "storage": "local",
    "pre_enrolled_keys": "1",
    "efitype": "4m"
  }
  ```

- `machine` - (string) - Set themachine type. i440fx or q35.

## Boot Command

The `boot_command` configuration is very important: it specifies the keys to
type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS
installer. This command is typed after `boot_wait`, which gives the virtual
machine some time to actually load the ISO.

As documented above, the `boot_command` is an array of strings. The strings
are all typed in sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within
the template.

The boot command is "typed" character for character over the virtual keyboard
to the machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard. The time
between keystrokes may be configured with `boot_key_interval`, the default
value is 15ms.

The boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys
to type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS
installer. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual
machine some time to actually load.

The boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in
sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.

There are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot
command, they will be replaced by the proper key:

-   `<bs>` - Backspace

-   `<del>` - Delete

-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual "enter" or "return" keypress.

-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.

-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.

-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.

-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.

-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.

-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.

-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.

-   `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down
    keys.

-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.

-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.

-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.

-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.

-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.

-   `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before
    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally
    wait for the UI to update before typing more.

-   `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.
    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with
    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.
    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For
    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.

-   `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these
     "special" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can
     also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use
     `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they
     will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,
     you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.

-   `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an
    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the
    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't
    specified, these will be blank!

-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.

Example boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an
CentOS 6.4 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [
    "<tab><wait>",
    " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
 ]
```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [
    "<tab><wait>",
    " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
 ]
```

The example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu
12.04 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [
  "<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
  "/install/vmlinuz noapic ",

## Http directory configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Packer will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a
random free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory
referenced will be available in your builder.

Example usage from a builder:

  `wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg`

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this
  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the
  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.
  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be
  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as
  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.

- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. http_content works like and
  conflicts with http_directory The keys represent the paths and the values
  contents. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By
  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The
  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in
  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below. Example: Setting
  `"foo/bar"="baz"`, will allow you to http get on
  `http://{http_ip}:{http_port}/foo/bar`.

- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server
  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in
  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to
  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one
  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values
  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.

- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max

- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that
  it will work with any network interface.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


## Example: Fedora with kickstart

Here is a basic example creating a Fedora 29 server image with a Kickstart
file served with Packer's HTTP server. Note that the iso file needs to be
manually downloaded.
