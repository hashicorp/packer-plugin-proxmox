# Proxmox Builder (from an ISO)

Type: `proxmox-iso`
Artifact BuilderId: `proxmox.iso`

The `proxmox-iso` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve). The builder takes an ISO
image, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then
creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to
create new virtual machines within Proxmox.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

If no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used
in the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.

### Required:

- `proxmox_url` (string) - URL to the Proxmox API, including the full path,
  so `https://<server>:<port>/api2/json` for example.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_URL` environment variable.

- `username` (string) - Username when authenticating to Proxmox, including
  the realm. For example `user@pve` to use the local Proxmox realm. When using
  token authentication, the username must include the token id after an exclamation
  mark. For example, `user@pve!tokenid`.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_USERNAME` environment variable.

- `password` (string) - Password for the user.
  For API tokens please use `token`.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `token` (string) - Token for authenticating API calls.
  This allows the API client to work with API tokens instead of user passwords.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `node` (string) - Which node in the Proxmox cluster to start the virtual
  machine on during creation.

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_url` (string) - URL to an ISO file to upload to Proxmox, and then
  boot from. Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `iso_checksum` (string) - Checksum of the ISO file. Type of the checksum
  is infered based on string length, or can be explicitly prefixed with
  md5:, sha1:, sha256:, sha512: or set to none. Corruption of large files,
  such as ISOs, can occur during transfer from time to time. As such,
  setting this to none is not recommended.

### Optional:

- `vm_name` (string) - Name of the virtual machine during creation. If not
  given, a random uuid will be used.

- `vm_id` (int) - The ID used to reference the virtual machine. This will
  also be the ID of the final template. If not given, the next free ID on
  the node will be used.

- `memory` (int) - How much memory, in megabytes, to give the virtual
  machine. Defaults to `512`.

- `cores` (int) - How many CPU cores to give the virtual machine. Defaults
  to `1`.

  - `mac_address` (string) - Give the adapter a specific MAC address. If
    not set, defaults to a random MAC. If value is "repeatable", value of MAC
    address is deterministic based on VM ID and NIC ID.

  - `vlan_tag` (string) - If the adapter should tag packets. Defaults to

  - `firewall` (bool) - If the interface should be protected by the firewall.
    Defaults to `false`.

  - `packet_queues` (int) - Number of packet queues to be used on the device.
    Values greater than 1 indicate that the multiqueue feature is activated.
    For best performance, set this to the number of cores available to the
    virtual machine. CPU load on the host and guest systems will increase as
    the traffic increases, so activate this option only when the VM has to
    handle a great number of incoming connections, such as when the VM is
    operating as a router, reverse proxy or a busy HTTP server. Requires
    `virtio` network adapter. Defaults to `0`.

- `disks` (array of objects) - Disks attached to the virtual machine.
  Example:

      "storage_pool_type": "lvm"
    }
  ]
  ```

    `raw`.

  - `io_thread` (bool) - Create one I/O thread per storage controller, rather
    than a single thread for all I/O. This can increase performance when
    multiple disks are used. Requires `virtio-scsi-single` controller and a
    `scsi` or `virtio` disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_name` (string) - Name of the template. Defaults to the generated

  Defaults to `false`.

- `cloud_init_storage_pool` - (string) - Name of the Proxmox storage pool
  to store the Cloud-Init CDROM on. If not given, the storage pool of the boot device will be used.

- `additional_iso_files` (array of objects) - Additional ISO files attached to the virtual machine.
  Example:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "device": "scsi5",
      "iso_file": "local:iso/virtio-win-0.1.185.iso",
      "unmount": true,
      "iso_checksum": "af2b3cc9fa7905dea5e58d31508d75bba717c2b0d5553962658a47aebc9cc386"
    }
  ]
  ```

  - `device` (string) - Bus type and bus index that the ISO will be mounted on. Can be `ideX`,

    For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` form 0 to 5 and for
    `scsi` from 0 to 30.
    Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

  - `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
    proxmox datastore path, for example
    `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
    Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` OR `cd_files` must be specifed.

  - `iso_url` (string) - URL to an ISO file to upload to Proxmox, and then
    boot from. Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` OR `cd_files` must be specifed.

  - `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
    the ISO file.

  - `iso_checksum` (string) - Checksum of the ISO file.
  - `unmount` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template after finishing. Defaults to `false`.

  ### Optional
    - `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
      booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
      will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
      hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
      tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed. Overrides
      any of `iso_file` or `iso_url` set. Requires `iso_storage_pool` to be set

      Usage example (JSON):

      ```json
      "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
      "cd_label": "cidata",
      ```

      Usage example (HCL):

      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```

      The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
      CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
      used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.

      Since globbing is also supported,

      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```

      Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
      between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
      directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.

      Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
      that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
      tools:

        * xorriso
        * mkisofs
        * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
        * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)


    - `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
      contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
      files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
      the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.

      Usage example (HCL):

      ```hcl
      cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
      cd_content = {
        "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
        "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
      }
      cd_label = "cidata"
      ```

    - `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

- `http_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets
  `HTTPIP` from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.

- `vm_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets
  the VMs IP from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.

- `boot` - (string) - Override default boot order. Format example `order=virtio0;ide2;net0`.
  Prior to Proxmox 6.2-15 the format was `cdn` (c:CDROM -> d:Disk -> n:Network)

- `bios` - (string) - Set the machine bios. This can be set to ovmf or seabios. The default value is seabios.

- `efidisk` - (string) - Set the efidisk storage location. This need to be set if you use ovmf uefi boot

- `machine` - (string) - Set themachine type. i440fx or q35.
