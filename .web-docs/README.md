#### Builders

- [proxmox-clone](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/proxmox/latest/components/builder/clone) - The proxmox image
  builder is able to create new images for use with Proxmox VE. The builder takes a cloud-init enabled virtual machine
  template name, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after
  launching it, then creates a virtual machine template.
- [proxmox-iso](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/proxmox/latest/components/builder/iso) - The proxmox ISO
  builder is able to create new images for use with Proxmox VE. The builder
  takes an ISO source, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after
  launching it, then creates a virtual machine template.
