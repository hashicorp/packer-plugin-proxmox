Type: `proxmox-iso`
Artifact BuilderId: `proxmox.iso`

The `proxmox-iso` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve). The builder takes an ISO
image, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then
creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to
create new virtual machines within Proxmox.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

You may also want to take look at the general configuration references for
[VirtIO RNG device](#virtio-rng-device)
and [PCI Devices](#pci-devices)
configuration references, which can be found further down the page.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

If no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used
in the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

By default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer
cache into a "`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`" file.
Packer uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in
file mode in order to perform a download.

go-getter supports the following protocols:

* Local files
* Git
* Mercurial
* HTTP
* Amazon S3

Examples:
go-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is
also possible to specify the checksum type.

In JSON:

```json

	"iso_checksum": "946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2",

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the additionalISOsConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `device` (string) - Bus type and bus index that the ISO will be mounted on. Can be `ideX`,
  `sataX` or `scsiX`.
  For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` from 0 to 5 and for
  `scsi` from 0 to 30.
  Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

An iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.

By default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting
get placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the
second CD device.

This config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no
way to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at
boot time.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.
  
  Usage example (JSON):
  
  ```json
  "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
  "cd_label": "cidata",
  ```
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
  
  Since globbing is also supported,
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
  
  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
  tools:
  
    * xorriso
    * mkisofs
    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)

- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
  cd_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```

- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

- `packet_queues` (int) - Number of packet queues to be used on the device.
  Values greater than 1 indicate that the multiqueue feature is activated.
  For best performance, set this to the number of cores available to the
  virtual machine. CPU load on the host and guest systems will increase as
  the traffic increases, so activate this option only when the VM has to
  handle a great number of incoming connections, such as when the VM is
  operating as a router, reverse proxy or a busy HTTP server. Requires
  `virtio` network adapter. Defaults to `0`.

- `mac_address` (string) - Give the adapter a specific MAC address. If
  not set, defaults to a random MAC. If value is "repeatable", value of MAC
  address is deterministic based on VM ID and NIC ID.

- `mtu` (int) - Set the maximum transmission unit for the adapter. Valid
  range: 0 - 65520. If set to `1`, the MTU is inherited from the bridge
  the adapter is attached to. Defaults to `0` (use Proxmox default).

- `bridge` (string) - Required. Which Proxmox bridge to attach the
  adapter to.

- `vlan_tag` (string) - If the adapter should tag packets. Defaults to
  no tagging.

- `firewall` (bool) - If the interface should be protected by the firewall.

  than a single thread for all I/O. This can increase performance when
  multiple disks are used. Requires `virtio-scsi-single` controller and a
  `scsi` or `virtio` disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `discard` (bool) - Relay TRIM commands to the underlying storage. Defaults
  to false. See the
  [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_hard_disk_discard)
  for for further information.

- `ssd` (bool) - Drive will be presented to the guest as solid-state drive
  rather than a rotational disk.

### EFI Config

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the efiConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `efi_config` - (object) - Set the efidisk storage options. This needs to be set if you use ovmf uefi boot
  (supersedes the `efidisk` option).

  Usage example (JSON):

  ```json
  {
    "efi_storage_pool": "local",
    "pre_enrolled_keys": true,
    "efi_type": "4m"
  }
  ```

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the efiConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `efi_storage_pool` (string) - Name of the Proxmox storage pool to store the EFI disk on.

- `pre_enrolled_keys` (bool) - Whether Microsoft Standard Secure Boot keys should be pre-loaded on
  the EFI disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `efi_type` (string) - Specifies the version of the OVMF firmware to be used. Can be `2m` or `4m`.
  Defaults to `4m`.

### VirtIO RNG device

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `rng0` (object): Configure Random Number Generator via VirtIO.
A virtual hardware-RNG can be used to provide entropy from the host system to a guest VM helping avoid entropy starvation which might cause the guest system slow down.
The device is sourced from a host device and guest, his use can be limited: `max_bytes` bytes of data will become available on a `period` ms timer.
[PVE documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) recommends to always use a limiter to avoid guests using too many host resources.

HCL2 example:

```hcl

	rng0 {
	  source    = "/dev/urandom"
	  max_bytes = 1024
	  period    = 1000
	}

```

JSON example:

```json

	{
	    "rng0": {
	        "source": "/dev/urandom",
	        "max_bytes": 1024,
	        "period": 1000
	    }
	}

```

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->


#### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `source` (string) - Device on the host to gather entropy from.
  `/dev/urandom` should be preferred over `/dev/random` as Proxmox PVE documentation suggests.
  `/dev/hwrng` can be used to pass through a hardware RNG.
  Can be one of `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/hwrng`.

- `max_bytes` (int) - Maximum bytes of entropy allowed to get injected into the guest every `period` milliseconds.
  Use a lower value when using `/dev/random` since can lead to entropy starvation on the host system.
  `0` disables limiting and according to PVE documentation is potentially dangerous for the host.
  Recommended value: `1024`.

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `period` (int) - Period in milliseconds on which the the entropy-injection quota is reset.
  Can be a positive value.
  Recommended value: `1000`.

### PCI devices

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Allows passing through a host PCI device into the VM. For example, a graphics card
or a network adapter. Devices that are mapped into a guest VM are no longer available
on the host. A minimal configuration only requires either the `host` or the `mapping`
key to be specifed.

Note: VMs with passed-through devices cannot be migrated.

HCL2 example:

```hcl

	pci_devices {
	  host          = "0000:0d:00.1"
	  pcie          = false
	  device_id     = "1003"
	  legacy_igd    = false
	  mdev          = "some-model"
	  hide_rombar   = false
	  romfile       = "vbios.bin"
	  sub_device_id = ""
	  sub_vendor_id = ""
	  vendor_id     = "15B3"
	  x_vga         = false
	}

```

JSON example:

```json

	{
	  "pci_devices": {
	    "host"          : "0000:0d:00.1",
	    "pcie"          : false,
	    "device_id"     : "1003",
	    "legacy_igd"    : false,
	    "mdev"          : "some-model",
	    "hide_rombar"   : false,
	    "romfile"       : "vbios.bin",
	    "sub_device_id" : "",
	    "sub_vendor_id" : "",
	    "vendor_id"     : "15B3",
	    "x_vga"         : false
	  }
	}

```

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `host` (string) - The PCI ID of a host’s PCI device or a PCI virtual function. You can us the `lspci` command to list existing PCI devices. Either this or the `mapping` key must be set.

- `device_id` (string) - Override PCI device ID visible to guest.

- `legacy_igd` (bool) - Pass this device in legacy IGD mode, making it the primary and exclusive graphics device in the VM. Requires `pc-i440fx` machine type and VGA set to `none`. Defaults to `false`.

- `mapping` (string) - The ID of a cluster wide mapping. Either this or the `host` key must be set.

- `pcie` (bool) - Present the device as a PCIe device (needs `q35` machine model). Defaults to `false`.

- `mdev` (string) - The type of mediated device to use. An instance of this type will be created on startup of the VM and will be cleaned up when the VM stops.

- `hide_rombar` (bool) - Specify whether or not the device’s ROM BAR will be visible in the guest’s memory map. Defaults to `false`.

- `romfile` (string) - Custom PCI device rom filename (must be located in `/usr/share/kvm/`).

- `sub_device_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem device ID visible to guest.

- `sub_vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem vendor ID visible to guest.

- `vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI vendor ID visible to guest.

- `x_vga` (bool) - Enable vfio-vga device support. Defaults to `false`.

### Boot Command

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

The boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys
to type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS
installer. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual
machine some time to actually load.

The boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in
sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.

There are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot
command, they will be replaced by the proper key:

-   `<bs>` - Backspace

-   `<del>` - Delete

-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual "enter" or "return" keypress.

-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.

-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.

-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.

-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.

-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.

-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.

-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.

  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down
    keys.

-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.

-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.

-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.

-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.

-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.

  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before
    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally
    wait for the UI to update before typing more.

  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.
    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with
    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.
    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For
    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.

  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these
    "special" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can
    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use
    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they
    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,
    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.

  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an
    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the
    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't
    specified, these will be blank!

-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.

Example boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an
CentOS 6.4 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

The example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu
12.04 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [

	"<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
	"/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
	"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg ",
	"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us ",
	"hostname={{ .Name }} ",
	"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive ",
	"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA ",
	"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false ",
	"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>"

]
```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [

	"<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
	"/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
	"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg ",
	"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us ",
	"hostname={{ .Name }} ",
	"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive ",
	"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA ",
	"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false ",
	"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>"

]
```

For more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our
[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this
  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause
  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If
  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on
  the builder type.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.

### Http directory configuration

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Packer will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a
random free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory
referenced will be available in your builder.

Example usage from a builder:

```
wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg
```

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this
  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the
  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.
  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be
  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as
  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.

- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and
  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the
  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.
  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By
  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The
  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in
  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.
  Example:
  ```hcl
    http_content = {
      "/a/b"     = file("http/b")
      "/foo/bar" = templatefile("${path.root}/preseed.cfg", { packages = ["nginx"] })
    }
  ```

- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server
  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in
  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to
  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one
  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values
  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.

- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max

- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that
  it will work with any network interface.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


- `http_interface` - (string) - Name of the network interface that Packer gets
  `HTTPIP` from. Defaults to the first non loopback interface.

## Example: Fedora with kickstart

Here is a basic example creating a Fedora 29 server image with a Kickstart
file served with Packer's HTTP server. Note that the iso file needs to be
manually downloaded.
