Type: `proxmox-clone`
Artifact BuilderId: `proxmox.clone`

The `proxmox-clone` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve). The builder takes a virtual
machine template, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it,
then creates a virtual machine template. This template can then be used as to
create new virtual machines within Proxmox.

Disks specified in a `proxmox-clone` builder configuration will replace disks
that are already present on the cloned VM template. If you want to reuse the disks
of the cloned VM, don't specify disks in your configuration.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once it creates a template, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

You may also want to take look at the general configuration references for
[VirtIO RNG device](#virtio-rng-device)
and [PCI Devices](#pci-devices)
configuration references, which can be found further down the page.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

If no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used
in the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/proxmox/clone/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `clone_vm` (string) - The name of the VM Packer should clone and build from.
  Either `clone_vm` or `clone_vm_id` must be specifed.

- `clone_vm_id` (int) - The ID of the VM Packer should clone and build from.
  Proxmox VMIDs are limited to the range 100-999999999.
  Either `clone_vm` or `clone_vm_id` must be specifed.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

An iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.

By default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting
get placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the
second CD device.

This config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no
way to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at
boot time.

- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.
  
  Usage example (JSON):
  
  ```json
  "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
  "cd_label": "cidata",
  ```
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
  
  Since globbing is also supported,
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
  
  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
  tools:
  
    * xorriso
    * mkisofs
    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)

- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
  cd_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```

- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

  `scsi` or `virtio` disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `discard` (bool) - Relay TRIM commands to the underlying storage. Defaults
  to false. See the
  [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_hard_disk_discard)
  for for further information.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

By default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer
cache into a "`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`" file.
Packer uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in
file mode in order to perform a download.

go-getter supports the following protocols:

* Local files
* Git
* Mercurial
* HTTP
* Amazon S3

Examples:
go-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is
also possible to specify the checksum type.

In JSON:

```json

	"iso_checksum": "946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file://./shasums.txt",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file:./shasums.txt",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

In HCL2:

```hcl

	iso_checksum = "946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2"
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

	iso_checksum = "file:./shasums.txt",
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

#### Required

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.

#### Optional

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.
  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a
  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same
  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.
  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.

- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will
  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and
  checksum as its name.

  `sataX` or `scsiX`.
  For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` from 0 to 5 and for
  `scsi` from 0 to 30.
  Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the additionalISOsConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

An iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.

By default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting
get placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the
second CD device.

This config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no

- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.
  
  Usage example (JSON):
  
  ```json
  "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
  "cd_label": "cidata",
  ```
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
  
  Since globbing is also supported,
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
  
  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
  tools:
  
    * xorriso
    * mkisofs
    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)

- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
  cd_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```

- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

### EFI Config

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the efiConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `efi_config` - (object) - Set the efidisk storage options. This needs to be set if you use ovmf uefi boot
  (supersedes the `efidisk` option).

  Usage example (JSON):

  ```json
  {
    "efi_storage_pool": "local",
    "pre_enrolled_keys": true,
    "efi_type": "4m"
  }
  ```

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the efiConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `efi_storage_pool` (string) - Name of the Proxmox storage pool to store the EFI disk on.

- `pre_enrolled_keys` (bool) - Whether Microsoft Standard Secure Boot keys should be pre-loaded on
  the EFI disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `efi_type` (string) - Specifies the version of the OVMF firmware to be used. Can be `2m` or `4m`.
  Defaults to `4m`.

### VirtIO RNG device

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `rng0` (object): Configure Random Number Generator via VirtIO.
A virtual hardware-RNG can be used to provide entropy from the host system to a guest VM helping avoid entropy starvation which might cause the guest system slow down.
The device is sourced from a host device and guest, his use can be limited: `max_bytes` bytes of data will become available on a `period` ms timer.
[PVE documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) recommends to always use a limiter to avoid guests using too many host resources.

HCL2 example:

```hcl

	rng0 {
	  source    = "/dev/urandom"
	  max_bytes = 1024
	  period    = 1000
	}

```

JSON example:

```json

	{
	    "rng0": {
	        "source": "/dev/urandom",
	        "max_bytes": 1024,
	        "period": 1000
	    }
	}

```

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; -->


#### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `source` (string) - Device on the host to gather entropy from.
  `/dev/urandom` should be preferred over `/dev/random` as Proxmox PVE documentation suggests.
  `/dev/hwrng` can be used to pass through a hardware RNG.
  Can be one of `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/hwrng`.

- `max_bytes` (int) - Maximum bytes of entropy allowed to get injected into the guest every `period` milliseconds.
  Use a lower value when using `/dev/random` since can lead to entropy starvation on the host system.
  `0` disables limiting and according to PVE documentation is potentially dangerous for the host.
  Recommended value: `1024`.

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the rng0Config struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `period` (int) - Period in milliseconds on which the the entropy-injection quota is reset.
  Can be a positive value.
  Recommended value: `1000`.

### PCI devices

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Allows passing through a host PCI device into the VM. For example, a graphics card
or a network adapter. Devices that are mapped into a guest VM are no longer available
on the host. A minimal configuration only requires either the `host` or the `mapping`
key to be specifed.

Note: VMs with passed-through devices cannot be migrated.

HCL2 example:

```hcl

	pci_devices {
	  host          = "0000:0d:00.1"
	  pcie          = false
	  device_id     = "1003"
	  legacy_igd    = false
	  mdev          = "some-model"
	  hide_rombar   = false
	  romfile       = "vbios.bin"
	  sub_device_id = ""
	  sub_vendor_id = ""
	  vendor_id     = "15B3"
	  x_vga         = false
	}

```

JSON example:

```json

	{
	  "pci_devices": {
	    "host"          : "0000:0d:00.1",
	    "pcie"          : false,
	    "device_id"     : "1003",
	    "legacy_igd"    : false,
	    "mdev"          : "some-model",
	    "hide_rombar"   : false,
	    "romfile"       : "vbios.bin",
	    "sub_device_id" : "",
	    "sub_vendor_id" : "",
	    "vendor_id"     : "15B3",
	    "x_vga"         : false
	  }
	}

```

#### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the pciDeviceConfig struct in builder/proxmox/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `host` (string) - The PCI ID of a host’s PCI device or a PCI virtual function. You can us the `lspci` command to list existing PCI devices. Either this or the `mapping` key must be set.

- `device_id` (string) - Override PCI device ID visible to guest.

- `legacy_igd` (bool) - Pass this device in legacy IGD mode, making it the primary and exclusive graphics device in the VM. Requires `pc-i440fx` machine type and VGA set to `none`. Defaults to `false`.

- `mapping` (string) - The ID of a cluster wide mapping. Either this or the `host` key must be set.

- `pcie` (bool) - Present the device as a PCIe device (needs `q35` machine model). Defaults to `false`.

- `mdev` (string) - The type of mediated device to use. An instance of this type will be created on startup of the VM and will be cleaned up when the VM stops.

- `hide_rombar` (bool) - Specify whether or not the device’s ROM BAR will be visible in the guest’s memory map. Defaults to `false`.

- `romfile` (string) - Custom PCI device rom filename (must be located in `/usr/share/kvm/`).

- `sub_device_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem device ID visible to guest.

- `sub_vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem vendor ID visible to guest.

- `vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI vendor ID visible to guest.
