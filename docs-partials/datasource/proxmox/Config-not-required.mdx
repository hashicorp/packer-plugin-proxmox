- `proxmox_url` (string) - URL to the Proxmox API, including the full path,
  so `https://<server>:<port>/api2/json` for example.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_URL` environment variable.

- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool) - Skip validating the certificate.

- `username` (string) - Username when authenticating to Proxmox, including
  the realm. For example `user@pve` to use the local Proxmox realm. When using
  token authentication, the username must include the token id after an exclamation
  mark. For example, `user@pve!tokenid`.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_USERNAME` environment variable.

- `password` (string) - Password for the user.
  For API tokens please use `token`.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `token` (string) - Token for authenticating API calls.
  This allows the API client to work with API tokens instead of user passwords.
  Can also be set via the `PROXMOX_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Either `password` or `token` must be specifed. If both are set,
  `token` takes precedence.

- `task_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - `task_timeout` (duration string | ex: "10m") - The timeout for
   Promox API operations, e.g. clones. Defaults to 1 minute.

- `name` (string) - Filter that returns `vm_id` for guest which name exactly matches this value.
  Options `name` and `name_regex` are mutually exclusive.

- `name_regex` (string) - Filter that returns `vm_id` for guest which name matches the regular expression.
  Expression must use [Go Regex Syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax).
  Options `name` and `name_regex` are mutually exclusive.

- `template` (bool) - Filter that returns guest `vm_id` only when guest is template.

- `node` (string) - Filter that returns `vm_id` only when guest is located on the specified PVE node.

- `vm_tags` (string) - Filter that returns `vm_id` for guest which has all these tags. When you need to
  specify more than one tag, use semicolon as separator (`"tag1;tag2"`).
  Every specified tag must exist in guest.

- `latest` (bool) - This filter determines how to handle multiple guests that were matched with all
  previous filters. Guest creation time is being used to find latest.
  By default, multiple matching guests results in an error.
