- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `iso_download_pve` (bool) - Download the specified `iso_url` directly from
  the PVE node. Defaults to `false`.
  By default Packer downloads the ISO and uploads it in a second step, this
  option lets Proxmox handle downloading the ISO directly from the server.

- `unmount_iso` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template
  after finishing. Defaults to `false`.
