- `rng0` (object): Configure Random Number Generator via VirtIO.
A virtual hardware-RNG can be used to provide entropy from the host system to a guest VM helping avoid entropy starvation which might cause the guest system slow down.
The device is sourced from a host device and guest, his use can be limited: `max_bytes` bytes of data will become available on a `period` ms timer.
[PVE documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html) recommends to always use a limiter to avoid guests using too many host resources.

HCL2 example:

```hcl

	rng0 {
	  source    = "/dev/urandom"
	  max_bytes = 1024
	  period    = 1000
	}

```

JSON example:

```json

	{
	    "rng0": {
	        "source": "/dev/urandom",
	        "max_bytes": 1024,
	        "period": 1000
	    }
	}

```
