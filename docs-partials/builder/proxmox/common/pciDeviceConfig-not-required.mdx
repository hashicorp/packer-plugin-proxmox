- `host` (string) - The PCI ID of a host’s PCI device or a PCI virtual function. You can us the `lspci` command to list existing PCI devices. Either this or the `mapping` key must be set.

- `device_id` (string) - Override PCI device ID visible to guest.

- `legacy_igd` (bool) - Pass this device in legacy IGD mode, making it the primary and exclusive graphics device in the VM. Requires `pc-i440fx` machine type and VGA set to `none`. Defaults to `false`.

- `mapping` (string) - The ID of a cluster wide mapping. Either this or the `host` key must be set.

- `pcie` (bool) - Present the device as a PCIe device (needs `q35` machine model). Defaults to `false`.

- `mdev` (string) - The type of mediated device to use. An instance of this type will be created on startup of the VM and will be cleaned up when the VM stops.

- `hide_rombar` (bool) - Specify whether or not the device’s ROM BAR will be visible in the guest’s memory map. Defaults to `false`.

- `romfile` (string) - Custom PCI device rom filename (must be located in `/usr/share/kvm/`).

- `sub_device_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem device ID visible to guest.

- `sub_vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI subsystem vendor ID visible to guest.

- `vendor_id` (string) - Override PCI vendor ID visible to guest.

- `x_vga` (bool) - Enable vfio-vga device support. Defaults to `false`.
