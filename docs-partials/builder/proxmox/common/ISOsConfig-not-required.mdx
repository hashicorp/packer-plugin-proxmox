- `type` (string) - Bus type that the ISO will be mounted on. Can be `ide`, `sata` or `scsi`. Defaults to `ide`.
  
  In v1.9 bus indexes are no longer accepted for ISOs. ISOs are now attached to VMs in the order
  they are configured, using free bus indexes after disks are attached.
  Example: if two Disks and one ISO are defined as type `sata`, the disks will be attached to the VM
  as `sata0`, `sata1`, and the ISO will be mapped to `sata2` (the next free device index)

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `iso_download_pve` (bool) - Download the ISO directly from the PVE node rather than through Packer.
  
  Defaults to `false`

- `unmount` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template after finishing. Defaults to `false`.

- `keep_cdrom_device` (bool) - Keep CDRom device attached to template if unmounting ISO. Defaults to `false`.
  Has no effect if unmount is `false`
