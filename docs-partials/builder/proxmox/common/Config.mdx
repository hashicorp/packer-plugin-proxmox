There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

You may also want to take look at the general configuration references for
[VirtIO RNG device](#virtio-rng-device)
and [PCI Devices](#pci-devices)
configuration references, which can be found further down the page.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

If no communicator is defined, an SSH key is generated for use, and is used
in the image's Cloud-Init settings for provisioning.
