- `type` (string) - The type of disk. Can be `scsi`, `sata`, `virtio` or
  `ide`. Defaults to `scsi`.

- `storage_pool` (string) - Required. Name of the Proxmox storage pool
  to store the virtual machine disk on. A `local-lvm` pool is allocated
  by the installer, for example.

- `storage_pool_type` (string) - This option is deprecated.

- `disk_size` (string) - The size of the disk, including a unit suffix, such
  as `10G` to indicate 10 gigabytes.

- `cache_mode` (string) - How to cache operations to the disk. Can be
  `none`, `writethrough`, `writeback`, `unsafe` or `directsync`.
  Defaults to `none`.

- `format` (string) - The format of the file backing the disk. Can be
  `raw`, `cow`, `qcow`, `qed`, `qcow2`, `vmdk` or `cloop`. Defaults to
  `raw`.

- `io_thread` (bool) - Create one I/O thread per storage controller, rather
  than a single thread for all I/O. This can increase performance when
  multiple disks are used. Requires `virtio-scsi-single` controller and a
  `scsi` or `virtio` disk. Defaults to `false`.

- `asyncio` (string) - Configure Asynchronous I/O. Can be `native`, `threads`, or `io_uring`.
  Defaults to io_uring.

- `exclude_from_backup` (bool) - Exclude disk from Proxmox backup jobs
  Defaults to false.

- `discard` (bool) - Relay TRIM commands to the underlying storage. Defaults
  to false. See the
  [Proxmox documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pve-admin-guide.html#qm_hard_disk_discard)
  for for further information.

- `ssd` (bool) - Drive will be presented to the guest as solid-state drive
  rather than a rotational disk.
  
  This cannot work with virtio disks.

- `skip_replication` (bool) - Exclude disk from replication jobs.
  Defaults to false.
