- `model` (string) - Model of the virtual network adapter. Can be
  `rtl8139`, `ne2k_pci`, `e1000`, `pcnet`, `virtio`, `ne2k_isa`,
  `i82551`, `i82557b`, `i82559er`, `vmxnet3`, `e1000-82540em`,
  `e1000-82544gc` or `e1000-82545em`. Defaults to `e1000`.

- `packet_queues` (int) - Number of packet queues to be used on the device.
  Values greater than 1 indicate that the multiqueue feature is activated.
  For best performance, set this to the number of cores available to the
  virtual machine. CPU load on the host and guest systems will increase as
  the traffic increases, so activate this option only when the VM has to
  handle a great number of incoming connections, such as when the VM is
  operating as a router, reverse proxy or a busy HTTP server. Requires
  `virtio` network adapter. Defaults to `0`.

- `mac_address` (string) - Give the adapter a specific MAC address. If
  not set, defaults to a random MAC. If value is "repeatable", value of MAC
  address is deterministic based on VM ID and NIC ID.

- `mtu` (int) - Set the maximum transmission unit for the adapter. Valid
  range: 0 - 65520. If set to `1`, the MTU is inherited from the bridge
  the adapter is attached to. Defaults to `0` (use Proxmox default).

- `bridge` (string) - Required. Which Proxmox bridge to attach the
  adapter to.

- `vlan_tag` (string) - If the adapter should tag packets. Defaults to
  no tagging.

- `firewall` (bool) - If the interface should be protected by the firewall.
  Defaults to `false`.
