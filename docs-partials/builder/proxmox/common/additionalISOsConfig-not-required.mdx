- `device` (string) - Bus type and bus index that the ISO will be mounted on. Can be `ideX`,
  `sataX` or `scsiX`.
  For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` from 0 to 5 and for
  `scsi` from 0 to 30.
  Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

- `iso_file` (string) - Path to the ISO file to boot from, expressed as a
  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `iso_download_pve` (bool) - Download the ISO directly from the PVE node rather than through Packer.
  
  Defaults to `false`

- `unmount` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template after finishing. Defaults to `false`.

- `unmount_keep_device` (bool) - Keep CDRom device attached to template if unmounting ISO. Defaults to `false`.
  Has no effect if unmount is `false`
