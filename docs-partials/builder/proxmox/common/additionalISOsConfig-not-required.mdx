- `device` (string) - Bus type and bus index that the ISO will be mounted on. Can be `ideX`,
  `sataX` or `scsiX`.
  For `ide` the bus index ranges from 0 to 3, for `sata` form 0 to 5 and for
  `scsi` from 0 to 30.
  Defaults to `ide3` since `ide2` is generally the boot drive.

  proxmox datastore path, for example
  `local:iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-29-1.2.iso`.
  Either `iso_file` OR `iso_url` must be specifed.

- `iso_storage_pool` (string) - Proxmox storage pool onto which to upload
  the ISO file.

- `unmount` (bool) - If true, remove the mounted ISO from the template after finishing. Defaults to `false`.
